# SecureLibrary

SecureLibrary is a lightweight and easy-to-use .NET library for AES encryption and decryption. It allows you to securely encrypt and decrypt text values using a password-based approach, ensuring your data remains protected.

## Features

- **Strong AES Encryption:** Uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to secure your data.
- **Password Protection:** Encrypt and decrypt text with a user-provided password.
- **Random Initialization Vector (IV):** Generates a new IV for every encryption operation for enhanced security.
- **Simple API:** Easy-to-use methods for encryption and decryption.
- **Compatible:** Targets `.NET Standard 2.0`, making it usable across a wide range of .NET platforms.

## Benefits

- **Data Security:** Ensure sensitive information is encrypted with industry-standard AES encryption.
- **Ease of Use:** Simple API allows for quick integration into your applications.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Works seamlessly across different .NET environments.
- **Reusable:** Implement encryption and decryption logic consistently across projects.

## Installation

To use SecureLibrary in your project, add the NuGet package:

```bash
dotnet add package SecureLibrary
```

Alternatively, download the `.nupkg` file from the releases section and add it to your local NuGet source.

## Usage

### Encrypt a Text Value

```csharp
using SecureLibrary;

string password = "StrongPassword123!";
string plainText = "This is a secret message.";

string encryptedText = Encryptor.Encrypt(plainText, password);
Console.WriteLine($"Encrypted Text: {encryptedText}");
```

### Decrypt a Text Value

```csharp
string decryptedText = Encryptor.Decrypt(encryptedText, password);
Console.WriteLine($"Decrypted Text: {decryptedText}");
```

### Output Example

```
Encrypted Text: /m3Nt5xP6JwrD0iTnzgfGQ==
Decrypted Text: This is a secret message.
```

## How It Works

1. **Encryption:**
   - Converts the password into a cryptographic key using SHA256.
   - Encrypts the input text using AES encryption with the generated key and a random IV.
   - Prepends the IV to the encrypted data for use during decryption.

2. **Decryption:**
   - Extracts the IV from the encrypted data.
   - Recreates the cryptographic key using the password.
   - Decrypts the encrypted data using the recreated key and the extracted IV.
